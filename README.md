# 3CG
Center-Corner Cubes Growing (3CG) algorithm for determining the representative elementary volume (REV) of pore space in a binarized image stack.

3CG operates by analyzing porosity within cubes growing from each of the eight corners and a central region of a 3D binarized image.

Install Jupyter Notebook or Python 3.9.16 for work.

Use TIF or PNG format for the image stack. The pores should be white (1) on binarized images.
